# Welcome

Hi, my name is David Meltzer and I am a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical physics at Cornell University. 

My research work in physics was primarily on the study of formal aspects of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Currently, I am interested in various aspects of Machine Learning (ML), including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and how lessons from physics can be used to understand large neural nets.

I have written a few Weights and Biases reports concerning ML projects on <a href="https://wandb.ai/dmeltzer/gutenberg/reports/Copy-of-Visualizing-Literature-using-Transformers--Vmlldzo1NzU5NjU0">"Visualizing Literature with Transformers"</a>, <a href="https://wandb.ai/dmeltzer/Question_Generation/reports/Learning-to-Ask-Scientific-Questions--Vmlldzo0MjMxMzE1">Using Transformers for Scientific Question Generation</a>, and <a href="https://wandb.ai/dmeltzer/mlops-course-assgn3/reports/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Goodreads-Reviews-Part-3---VmlldzozNzYxODkz">Sentiment Classification for Book Reviews</a>. I have also written three Streamlit applications which utilize large language models that are hosted on Huggingface. For the "Scientific Question Generation" project I wrote two apps, one for <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhmeltzer/qg_generation">question generation</a> and another for performing <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhmeltzer/semantic">semantic searches</a> over the dataset. Finally, I also wrote an application for the sentiment classification project which <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhmeltzer/Sentiment-of-Book-Reviews">predicts review ratings</a> using BERT-style transformers. More details, including code and additional reports can be found in my repositories.
