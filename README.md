# Welcome

Hi, my name is David Meltzer and I am a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical physics at Cornell University. 

My research work in physics was primarily on the study of formal aspects of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Currently, I am interested in various aspects of Machine Learning (ML), including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and how lessons from physics can be used to understand large neural nets.
